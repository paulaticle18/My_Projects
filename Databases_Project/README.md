The provided SQL code sets up a database schema for organizing exams. It creates tables such as tara (country), judet (county), oras (city), adresa (address), persoane_rol (person roles), persoane (persons), grupe_studii (study groups), cursuri (courses), note_cursuri (course grades), studenti_cursuri (student-course relationship), and prof_cursuri (professor-course relationship).

Sample data is inserted into these tables, including countries, counties, cities, addresses, person roles (e.g., student, professor), persons' information (name, contact details, group, role), study groups, courses (name, description, professor, credits), course grades (including session, exam type, credits, grade, and pass status), and relationships between students and courses, and professors and courses.

The code also includes various SQL queries that retrieve information from the database, such as retrieving students enrolled in a specific course, course names and professors, group codes and leaders, grades of students at a specific course, etc.

Overall, the code demonstrates the creation of tables, insertion of data, defining relationships between tables, retrieving information using SQL queries, and performing calculations and updates on the data.
