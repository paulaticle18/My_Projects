The project creates a web-based platform for a coffee shop where users can view, add, edit, and delete products from the shop's menu. The website has multiple pages and features a navigation bar for easy navigation between pages.

Home Page:

The home page welcomes users to the coffee shop with a catchy heading and a message about starting the day with a perfect coffee.
The page has a visually appealing background image and styling to create an inviting atmosphere.
Navigation Bar:

The navigation bar is present on every page of the website to facilitate easy navigation.
It includes links to various sections of the website, such as the home page, product listing page, add product page, delete product page, and edit product page.
Product Listing Page:

The "Our Products" page displays a table that shows the existing products available at the coffee shop.
Each row of the table represents a product and includes details like coffee name, price, amount, ingredients, comments, and rating.
The page retrieves this information from a MySQL database using PHP and displays it dynamically.
Add Product Page:

The "Add a Product" page provides a form for users to add a new product to the coffee shop's menu.
The form includes input fields for the coffee name, price, amount, ingredients, comments, and rating.
Upon submitting the form, the data is validated and stored in the MySQL database.
Delete Product Page:

The "Delete a Product" page displays a table similar to the product listing page but with an additional column for the "Delete" action.
Each row has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove a specific product from the menu.
When the button is clicked, the corresponding product is deleted from the database.
Edit Product Page:

The "Edit a Product" page shows a table with the existing products and an additional column for the "Edit" action.
Each row has an "Edit" button that directs users to a form for modifying the details of a specific product.
The form is pre-filled with the current product details, and users can update the desired fields.
Upon submission, the changes are validated and saved to the database.
Overall, the project provides a user-friendly interface for managing the coffee shop's menu. Users can view the available products, add new products, delete unwanted products, and edit existing product details. The website leverages HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to achieve this functionality.
